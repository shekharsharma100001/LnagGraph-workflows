# üöÄ Agentic AI with LangGraph

This repository contains my learning and implementations while studying **Agentic AI using LangGraph** from the CampusX YouTube playlist.  
The code here follows along with the tutorials and also includes my own practice experiments to understand how agentic workflows can be built step by step.

## üìå About the Project
- LangGraph is a framework built on top of LangChain for creating **stateful, multi-step, agent-like workflows**.
- In this repo, I‚Äôve explored the basics of LangGraph such as:
  - Creating nodes (functions as graph states).
  - Adding edges between nodes.
  - Using the special `END` node to terminate workflows.
  - Building small agent-like systems for problem solving.
- The focus is on learning by coding along with the CampusX playlist.
